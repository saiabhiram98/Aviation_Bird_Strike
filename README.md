## Introduction
This app presents multiple analyses of aviation bird strikes in America spanning 33 years.Bird strikes involving airplanes occur when birds collide with aircraft during flight, takeoff, or landing, posing substantial risks to aviation safety. These incidents have the potential to cause damage to crucial aircraft components, including engines and wings.

In this application, you will find visualizations covering:

- Historical analysis of bird strikes on aircraft.
- Visualization of bird strike patterns over time and locations.
- Insights into the types of birds involved in strikes.
- Analysis of which phase of the flight is more prone to bird strikes.
- Evaluation of costs incurred due to bird strikes.


## Data Source

The app utilizes data sourced from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) website: [FAA Wildlife Strike Database](https://wildlife.faa.gov/search).

## Future Work

In future iterations of the Aviation Bird Strikes project, I aim to integrate the current data with the migratory patterns of birds. This will provide valuable insights into bird behavior and flight paths, allowing us to anticipate and mitigate the risks of bird strikes more effectively.
