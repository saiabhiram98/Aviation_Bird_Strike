## Introduction

This app shows us the multiple analysis of aviation bird strikes in America over the period of 33 years. 
Bird strikes involving airplanes occur when birds collide with aircraft during flight, takeoff, or landing, posing substantial risks to aviation safety. These incidents have the potential to cause damage to crucial aircraft components, including engines and wings. In the application you will find visualization on the following:

- Analyze historical data of bird strikes on aircraft.
- Visualize bird strike patterns over time and locations.
- Provide insights into the types of birds involved in strikes.
- Analyze which phase of the flight is more prone to bird strikes.
- Cost incurred due to the bird strikes.

## Data Source

The data that is used in the app has been taken from the Federal Aviation Administration(FAA) website -

## Future Work

In future iterations of the Aviation Bird Strikes project, I aim to integrate the current data with the migratory patterns of birds. This will provide valuable insights into bird behavior and flight paths, allowing us to anticipate and mitigate the risks of bird strikes more effectively.
